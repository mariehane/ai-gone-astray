# Item Maps
This folder includes three data files that contain mappings between low-level itemids and high-level features.

These are based on maps from [MIMIC-Extract](https://github.com/MLforHealth/MIMIC_Extract) by Shirly Wang, Matthew B. A. McDermott, Geeticka Chauhan, Michael C. Hughes, Tristan Naumann, 
and Marzyeh Ghassemi.
